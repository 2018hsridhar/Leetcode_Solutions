164. Maximum Gap
URL = https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-gap/

THOUGHT PROCESS : 
Let us test our knowledge of the radix sort algorithm
Things I will ask you in a sort algorithm : 
1. What are your keys used here?
2. How to handle case of shared keys? Is your sort algorithm stable or unstable?
3. What subroutine are you using?
4. Can we establish the depth of a sorting algorithm ( e.g. Radix / Merge ) . If recursive, note time and space complexity of each step
5. Is the sorting algorithm in-place or uses external memory?
6. Can we establish a type of convergence?
7. Is it a comparitive ( e.g. merge/quick ) or a non-comparative sort algorithm?
8. Talk about sorting algorithms in terms of keys ( not elements ) : sometimes, we compute some info from each element.



EDGE CASES : 
Singleton array case -> return 0


DATA TYPE LIMITS : 
Length of array reasonably guranteed from 1,2,....100,000
Elements of array reasonably guaranteed from 1,2,...,1,000,000,000
