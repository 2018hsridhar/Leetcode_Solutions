829. Consecutive Numbers Sum

COMPLEXITY
Let N := the number provided
TIME = ___
SPACE = ___ ( explicit ) ___ ( implicit ) 

TEST CASES
(A) n = 1
    =>1
(B) n = 2
    =>1
(C) n = 3
    =>2
(B) n = 5
    =>2
(C) n = 4
    => 0
(C) n = 9
(D) n = 14
(E) 
(F) n = 10e3 = 1,000
(G) n = 10e6 = 1,000,000
(H) n = 10e8 = 100,000,000
(I) n = 10e9 = 1,000,000,000

Test power in series : we note how they get stopped as well too
10e9 possible integer elmeents in a contiguous array?

Strategies : Recursion, DP, Iteration, Combinations
