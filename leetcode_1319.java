ATTEMPT THE UNION-FIND SOLUTION AGAIN HERE
URL = https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/
1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected
Return min times needed to extract specific cables and place between disconnected cables to connect the entire network
If (#_extra_cables)<(#_seperate_connected_components), return -1

As UNION_FIND tends to be it's own data structure, we want to write up a class
Easiest to represent via an array too
Also easy to obtain root of a node too


COMPLEXITY : 


TEST CASES : 


Limitations of the Union-Find Algorithm
(1) Does NOT work without in-memory storage
(2) Does NOT work if we do NOT know the total number of nodes to perform operation on
